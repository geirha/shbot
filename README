Shbot is an IRC bot that runs shell code. It is a fork of evalbot
(http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/evalbot/).

To build, you'll need

- Typical build tools: A C compiler, make, yacc, lex patch
- Header files of libraries needed to build bash, awk, mksh etc.
- Other standard and typical commands, like gzip, bzip2 and pax.

To grab the latest bash development branch from Git so it can be built

    git submodule init && git submodule update && cd bash && \
    git checkout devel

For Ubuntu/Debian

    sudo apt-get install build-essential pax ncompress
    sudo apt-get build-dep bash gawk mawk ksh mksh

For Fedora/CentOS
    sudo yum install pax patch ncompress flex byacc bison
    sudo yum-builddep bash gawk mawk ksh mksh

Should get most, if not all, build requirements down.

Run make
